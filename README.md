This study constructed two numerical models: one developed through Perform 3D, while the other was developed using SFIM. The details of SFIM can be found in Acosta (2019): Link (https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/97838). 

Users may want to download the entire folder "Steel_model_Perform3D" and place it under the appropriate Perform 3D directory to run the Perform 3D model. Pushover analysis can be conducted using the Perform 3D model. 

On the other hand, the SFIM model is available in the "Steel_model_SFIM" folder. Users need the S-Frame program to run this file.
