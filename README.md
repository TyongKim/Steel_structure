This study constructed two numerical models: one developed thorugh Perform 3D, while the other developed by using SFIM. The details of the SFIM can be found in Acosta (2019): https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/97838.\n

User may want to download the whole forder of "Steel_model_Perform3D" and store the folder uder the proper Perform 3D directory to run the perform 3D model. Pushover anlaysis can be conduced using the Perform 3D model. \n

On the other hand, the SFIM model is available in the folder of "Steel_model_SFIM." User need S-Frame program to run this file.
